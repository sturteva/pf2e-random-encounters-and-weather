##These are my ideas on what should be added, in no particular order##

-Finish _Quest for the Frozen Flame_ random encounters
-Add _Kingmaker_ Random Encounters
-Create Macro/functionality that allows user to select an available adventure and input party level/zone level
-Create Macro/functionality that allows user to select a region to determine Weather tables to be used (some meta-regions may be split up, like Saga Lands and Broken Lands have at least 2 distinct climate regions, in my opinion)
-Create a unified macro/functionality that initiates both Random Encounter and Random Weather
