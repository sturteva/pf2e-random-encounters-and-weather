This module is intended to hold a few features for the foundry vtt pf2e system that could well have been separate
modules and may well be eaten by the system at some point.

My current ideas (as in, no guarantee they'll ever actually get done) can be seen [here](featureIdeas.md)

## The Programmer's Mantra

```
It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion
It is by the beans of Java that thoughts acquire speed
The hands acquire shakes
The shakes become a warning
It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion
```
